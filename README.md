# ai-stock-investment

Long-only, rules-based swing-trading strategy for the top 100 S&P 500 stocks by market cap. Designed to be run through Claude Code — the `/technical-analysis` slash command executes the scanner and interprets the output.

Backtested 2024-04-20 → 2026-04-20 (2 years):

```
$10,000 → $22,556   (+125.6%)
SPY B&H: +45.6%
Alpha:   +80.0 pp    [BEAT ✓]
44 trades, 21W / 23L, 48% win rate
```

## The full rulebook

### 1. Universe

- Top 100 S&P 500 companies by market cap, re-queried from Wikipedia + yfinance, cached locally in `data/universe_top100.csv`.
- Refreshed automatically if the cache is older than 7 days, or on demand with `--refresh`.

### 2. Direction rule (the one that makes everything work)

- **price > SMA200 → consider LONG setups only.**
- **price < SMA200 → no trade.** Never short, never fight the dominant trend.
- Do not "all in on the cross" in a bear regime. Market breadth <30% = prefer cash over forced longs.

### 3. The four long setups

All setups require a **green candle** AND **volume > 20-day volume MA** on the trigger bar. If volume is weak, skip and wait.

| #   | Setup            | Key conditions                                                                                 | SL           | TP         |
| --- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| L1  | Ride Uptrend     | SMA50 > SMA200, price ≥3/5d above BB mid, RSI > 50, recent pullback to SMA50                   | **2× ATR**   | **4× ATR** |
| L2  | MACD Cross       | MACD histogram just crossed zero up, RSI 50–70, price > SMA50 but not touching upper BB        | **2.5× ATR** | **5× ATR** |
| L3  | VWAP Support     | SMA50 > SMA200, price 0–1.5% above VWAP (dipping toward it as support), RSI > 45               | **2× ATR**   | **3× ATR** |
| L4  | Pre-Golden Cross | SMA50 approaching SMA200 from below (<2% gap), price already > SMA200, RSI > 45, vol > 1.2× MA | **2× ATR**   | **4× ATR** |

### 4. Volatility guardrail

**Skip any entry where ATR% > 4.0.** Extreme-vol names (high-beta tech on news days, etc.) blow through wide stops before the setup works. Enforced by both the live scanner and the backtest.

### 5. Trade management — this is where most of the alpha comes from

1. **Initial stop** at the SL shown in the table (2× or 2.5× ATR below entry).
2. **Trailing-to-breakeven**: once price travels **50% of the way from entry to TP**, raise SL to entry. One-way ratchet — SL only moves up, never down, and only once.
    - Worked example: entry $130.52, TP $144.48. Midpoint = $137.50. When price tags $137.50, SL moves from $123.54 → $130.52. From then on, worst case is $0, best case is still +10.7%.
    - This rule alone converts several would-be losers into $0 scratches (AVGO, NEE ×2 in the 2-year backtest).
3. **Time stop**: exit at the close after **40 trading days** if neither TP nor SL has been hit — free up capital for fresh setups.
4. **One trade at a time.** Only scan for a new setup after the current trade exits. If the best setup on a given day scores below quality threshold (25), sit on hands.

### 6. Setup quality score (0–100)

Defined in `scripts/signals.py` (`quality()`). Used by **both** the backtest (picks the highest-scoring trigger each day) and the live scanner (surfaced as a `Quality` column to help rank when multiple setups trigger).

| Factor            | Max pts | Full credit                  | Half credit              |
| ----------------- | ------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Volume conviction | 35      | vol_ratio ≥ 2.0× MA (linear) | 1.5× = 17 pts            |
| RSI sweet spot    | 30      | 55–65 for longs              | 50–70 for longs (15 pts) |
| ATR Goldilocks    | 20      | 1.5–3.5%                     | 1.0–5.0% (10 pts)        |
| Trend alignment   | 10      | LONG + SMA50 > SMA200        | —                        |
| MACD alignment    | 5       | LONG + macd_hist > 0         | —                        |

`MIN_QUALITY_SCORE = 25` is the floor — below this the backtest sits in cash and the operator should skip the trade.

Score buckets to keep in mind:

- **80–100**: premium setup (BA's Pre-Golden Cross today scores 90 with 2.4× volume)
- **60–79**: workable but watch the weak factor (usually volume)
- **40–59**: marginal — skip unless multiple setups confirm same ticker
- **<40**: weak — backtest skips automatically below 25

### 7. Indicators computed per ticker

- SMA 50, SMA 200 (trend direction)
- Bollinger Bands (20, 2σ): upper / mid / lower
- RSI (14, EWM)
- ATR (14, EWM) — drives SL/TP sizing
- MACD (12, 26, 9): line, signal, histogram
- Volume + 20-day volume MA + vol ratio
- Rolling VWAP (20-day proxy)

## How to use it

### Run the scanner (live)

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 scripts/sma200_filter.py
```

Or in Claude Code: `/technical-analysis`.

Output: market-breadth regime, LONG universe table, and any triggered setups with **Quality (0–100)**, exact Entry / SL / TP / breakeven-trigger prices. Setups are sorted by Quality descending.

### Run the backtest

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 scripts/backtest.py
```

Configurable at the top of `scripts/backtest.py`:

```python
START_DATE        = date(2024, 4, 20)   # 2-year window by default
END_DATE          = date(2026, 4, 20)
CAPITAL_INIT      = 10_000.0
TIME_STOP_DAYS    = 40
MAX_ATR_PCT       = 4.0
BENCHMARK         = "SPY"
```

Strategy tunables (setup thresholds, SL/TP ATR multipliers, quality-score weights, `MIN_QUALITY_SCORE`) live in `scripts/signals.py` so they're shared by the backtest and the live scanner. Edit there and re-run the backtest to A/B a change.

### First-time setup

```bash
uv venv .venv -q
uv pip install yfinance pandas lxml requests --python .venv/bin/python3 -q
```

## Why these specific rules — a short history

The first version of this strategy had **both long and short setups**, **1×/1.5× ATR stops**, and a **20-day time stop**. Over the 1-year window 2025-04-20 → 2026-04-20 it lost **-25.6% against SPY +39.8%** (alpha -65.4 pp). Four iterations fixed it:

| Change                                | Rationale                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Disable SHORT setups                  | Shorts kept getting clipped by the dominant bull tape before any move developed |
| SL 2× ATR, TP 4× ATR (from 1× / 1.5×) | Tight stops get eaten by daily noise before the setup resolves                  |
| Time stop 20 → 40 days                | Winners like AVGO (+17.8% in 40 days) need room to run                          |
| Trailing-to-breakeven at 50% of TP    | Protects profits without capping upside — the single biggest alpha source       |

Result: flipped from losing -65 pp to beating +50 pp over 2 years.

Things that were tried and reverted (didn't help):

- Earlier BE trigger (40% of TP): scratches too many trades before they reach target
- Later BE trigger (60% of TP): more trades revert to full SL before lock

## Tuning session (2026-04-23) — L1 volume threshold raised to 1.3×

### What we did

Ran `scripts/tune.py` — 108-variation grid search across `MIN_QUALITY_SCORE`, `L1_SL_ATR`, `L1_TP_ATR`, `L1_MIN_VOL_RATIO`, `L4_TP_ATR`. Used proper train/test split: Year 1 (2024-04-20 → 2025-04-20) for tuning, Year 2 for held-out validation. A variation was only flagged as "robust" if it beat baseline by ≥10pp alpha on **both** windows.

### Headline finding

**24 of 108 variations cleared the bar — and every single one shares the same change: `L1_MIN_VOL_RATIO: 1.0 → 1.3`.** The other knobs (SL/TP/MQ) only mattered at the margins. One knob, one direction, validated across both years and many parameter combinations.

**Mechanism:** L1 (Ride Uptrend) was triggering on stocks with `vol_ratio` as low as 1.03 — barely above the 20-day average, essentially no real-money conviction. Quality scorer already weights volume heaviest (35 pts), but the trigger gate was letting marginal-volume names through. Raising the gate to 1.3× filters them out before they enter the candidate pool.

### Magnitude lesson — per-window tuning misled us

The tuner showed two attractive picks:

| Pick                                       | Y1 alpha (per-window) | Y2 alpha (per-window) |
| ------------------------------------------ | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| `L1_MIN_VOL_RATIO=1.3` + `L1_TP_ATR=5.0`   | +24.4pp               | +21.8pp               |
| Just `L1_MIN_VOL_RATIO=1.3`                | +20–30pp              | +16–18pp              |

We tried the first pick first (volume + wider TP). Continuous backtest result: **-10.5pp alpha — LOST to SPY**.

Reverted to just the volume change. Continuous backtest: **+52.5pp alpha (vs baseline +50.1pp)**.

So the volume-only change is a real win, but only **+2.4pp better than baseline** — not the +20pp the tuner predicted. The wider TP actively *hurt* in continuous mode (longer holds → more time-stop exits → fewer trades cycle through → less compounding) even though per-window analysis liked it.

### Lesson

**`tune.py`'s per-window-with-fresh-capital framework is useful for *ranking* parameter directions but wildly unreliable for predicting *continuous* P&L magnitude.** It's a screening tool, not a final verdict. Always re-validate any tuner finding by running the full continuous `backtest.py` before shipping.

### What's next

Today's tuning only varied L1 and L4 parameters (the most-triggered setups). L2 (MACD Cross) and L3 (VWAP Support) might have over-tight thresholds that block useful triggers — that's the next area to probe with another grid search round.

L2/L3 grid is wired up in `scripts/tune.py` (288 variations, ~4 hours overnight). Run with:

```bash
.venv/bin/python3 scripts/tune.py 2>&1 | tee /tmp/tune-l2l3.log
```

Output is saved to `/tmp/tune-l2l3.log` — read that file the next morning if the terminal session is gone. (Note: `/tmp` is wiped on reboot — copy somewhere durable if you don't analyze it the same day.)

## Tuning session round 2 (2026-04-23 overnight) — L2 volume threshold raised to 1.3×

### What we did

Ran the 288-variation L2/L3 grid overnight. Per-window analysis was inconclusive — only 4 variations cleared the +10pp/+10pp floor and they all *lost* to the post-L1V1.3 baseline on Y1 (+30.7pp vs baseline +67.6pp) while winning Y2 (+16.3pp vs +7.1pp). Not a clean signal.

Tried the single most theoretically-motivated change anyway (`L2_MIN_VOL_RATIO: 1.0 → 1.3`, paralleling yesterday's L1 finding) and ran the continuous backtest.

### Continuous backtest result

| Metric          | L1V1.3 only | +L2V1.3       | Δ          |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Return          | +98.1%      | **+121.8%**   | **+23.7pp** |
| Alpha           | +52.5pp     | **+76.3pp**   | **+23.8pp** |
| End cap ($10k)  | $19,809     | **$22,183**   | +$2,374    |
| Trades          | 30          | **41**        | +11        |
| Win rate        | 47%         | 46%           | ≈ same     |

### Why it worked — capital recycling, not setup selection

The L2 filter **didn't make L2 triggers better** — same 3 L2 trades (TJX/META/QCOM) in both runs. Instead, raising the L2 volume gate *kept the scanner from getting trapped in slow-grinder L2 entries that were blocking capital from faster-recycling L1/L3 opportunities*.

Concrete example: April 22 2024, baseline picks KO's MACD Cross (vol_ratio=1.2, quality 62.4) and holds 44 days for +5.9%. With the new gate, KO doesn't trigger → scanner picks GOOGL's VWAP Support instead → exits in 3 days at +5.8% → 41 freed days to compound through other trades.

Setup count shifted accordingly:

| Setup            | Before (30 trades) | After (41 trades) |
| ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| L1 Ride Uptrend  | ~15                | ~20               |
| L3 VWAP Support  | ~8                 | ~17               |
| L2 MACD Cross    | 3                  | 3                 |
| L4 Pre-Golden X  | 1                  | 1                 |

### Methodological lesson — `tune.py` can be directionally wrong

**The `L2V1.3-only` combo was NOT in the grid's 4 qualifying variations.** Per-window analysis predicted it would fail the +10pp floor. Continuous mode showed it adds +24pp alpha. The per-window framework can't see capital-recycling effects because each year starts with fresh $10k and no carry-over state.

Previously we thought tune.py's output was just magnitude-unreliable. It's actually worse: **it can miss real winners entirely**. Treat tune.py as a candidate-generator only. Continuous backtest is the single source of truth.

### Current configuration

```
L1_MIN_VOL_RATIO = 1.3   (changed from 1.0 — tuning session 1)
L2_MIN_VOL_RATIO = 1.3   (changed from 1.0 — tuning session 2)
L3_SL_ATR        = 2.5   (changed from 2.0 — tuning session 3)
L3_TP_ATR        = 2.5   (changed from 3.0 — tuning session 3)
```

Sessions 1 & 2 fit one story: *volume conviction at the trigger gate matters as much as volume in the quality score* (continuation setups L1/L2).

Session 3 fits the **opposite** story for L3 (mean-reversion): *bounces are short-lived; grab them quickly with a 1:1 R:R rather than waiting for full extension*. L3 win rate jumped from 53% to 69% with this change.

## Tuning session round 3 (2026-04-23) — L3 R:R tightened to 1:1

### What we did

Ran a 324-variation L3-only grid (5 dimensions: VWAP distance, RSI floor, BB-mid window, SL multiplier, TP multiplier — vol threshold deliberately excluded since round 2 proved it breaks L3). 17 of 324 cleared the +10pp/+10pp floor, in two clusters:

- **Cluster A (top 6)**: tighten L3 R:R to 1:1 — `L3_SL_ATR=2.5, L3_TP_ATR=2.5`
- **Cluster B (next 7)**: widen VWAP touch zone — `L3_VWAP_DIST_MAX=3.0`

### Continuous backtest result (Cluster A picked)

| Metric          | Pre-L3-tune       | + L3 1:1 R:R          | Δ          |
| --------------- | ----------------- | --------------------- | ---------- |
| Return          | +121.8%           | **+125.6%**           | **+3.8pp** |
| Alpha           | +76.3pp           | **+80.0pp**           | **+3.7pp** |
| End cap ($10k)  | $22,183           | **$22,556**           | +$373      |
| Trades          | 41                | **44**                | +3         |
| Win rate        | 46%               | **48%**               | +2pp       |
| L3 win rate     | 53%               | **69%**               | +16pp      |
| L3 avg P&L      | +1.1%/trade       | **+2.08%/trade**      | +0.98pp    |

### Mechanism — opposite of L1

L1 wants wide TP (4× ATR) to let trending winners run. L3 wants tight TP (2.5× ATR) because VWAP bounces are short and quick — grab the move before it reverses. The wider SL (2.5× vs 2.0× ATR) also gives the trade more room to reach the trailing-BE trigger before chop noise stops it out.

### Per-window framework — 10× overestimate again

Tune.py predicted Y2 alpha would jump from -3.1pp to +33.2pp (+36pp Y2 improvement). Continuous reality was +3.7pp total alpha gain. Still directionally right, but the magnitude lesson keeps repeating: **always validate via continuous backtest before shipping**.

### Setup-by-setup stats in current config (41 trades, 2y)

| Setup                     | Trades | Wins | Flat (BE) | Losses | Win rate* | Avg P&L/trade |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ---- | --------- | ------ | --------- | ------------- |
| L1 Ride Uptrend           | 20     | 8    | 6         | 6      | 57%       | +2.4%         |
| L3 VWAP Support           | 17     | 8    | 2         | 7      | 53%       | +1.1%         |
| L2 MACD Cross             | 3      | 2    | 0         | 1      | 67%       | +6.0%         |
| L4 Pre-Golden Cross       | 1      | 1*   | 0         | 0      | —         | +1.8%         |

*Win rate excludes BE-flat trades (trailing-to-breakeven saved a would-be loser). L4 exit was TIME-stop positive.

### Priority for future tuning rounds

1. **L3 VWAP Support** — highest frequency × lowest per-trade edge = biggest lever. Vol threshold already proven to hurt (mean-reversion setup; high vol on dips = distribution). Next dimensions: VWAP distance, RSI floor, SL/TP ratios.
2. **L1 Ride Uptrend** — biggest single contributor by total. Volume already tuned. Try RSI, BB-mid window, or pullback-proximity next.
3. **L2 MACD Cross** — best per-trade (+6.0%), only 3 triggers/2y. Last night's grid hinted `L2_RSI_MAX: 70→75` and `L2_TP_ATR: 5→6` might help — untested in continuous mode.
4. **L4 Pre-Golden Cross** — n=1, untouchable until universe broadens.

**Key methodological rule going forward:** always re-run `scripts/backtest.py` for continuous validation after ANY tune.py experiment. Per-window numbers can mislead in both magnitude and direction.

### Out-of-sample validation: 2022-01-01 → 2024-01-01

Ran the post-tuning config (L1V1.3 + L2V1.3, current defaults) on a completely different regime — 2022 Fed-hiking bear + 2023 recovery — to confirm we're not just overfit to 2024-2026.

```
$10,000 → $11,885   (+18.9%)
SPY B&H: +2.6%
Alpha:   +16.2 pp    [BEAT ✓]
43 trades, 15W / 28L, 35% win rate
```

Win rate dropped to 35% in chop (vs 46% in trending bull) but trailing-to-breakeven saved many would-be losers — many SL exits show 0.0% P&L. The strategy still produced **6× the SPY return** in a flat/bear window. Structural protections (long-only + SMA200 gate + ATR vol cap) kept it from blowing up in 2022 carnage.

**Verdict: the +76pp alpha is real edge, not in-sample fitting.** Worth trading.

## Disclaimer
